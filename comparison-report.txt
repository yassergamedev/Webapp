KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. NAMING CONVENTIONS:
   - MongoDB uses shorter names (e.g., "24 Vol1" vs "Pophits 00-24 Vol1")
   - MongoDB omits artist prefixes (e.g., "Best Of" vs "Rolling Stones - Best Of")
   - File system includes full artist names in album folder names

2. MISSING DATA IN MONGODB:
   - 11 complete albums missing (HotHits Aus CD1-7, plus 4 others)
   - 177 songs from missing albums
   - Additional 48 songs missing from albums that exist in both

3. DATA COMPLETENESS:
   - File System: 39 albums, 540 songs
   - MongoDB: 28 albums, 315 songs
   - MongoDB is missing ~28% of albums and ~42% of songs

4. SONG COUNT DIFFERENCES IN MATCHING ALBUMS:
   - Some albums may have different song counts due to:
     * Different naming/matching logic
     * Songs not properly imported to MongoDB
     * Songs filtered out during import

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. Import missing albums from file system to MongoDB:
   - HotHits Aus CD1-7 (112 songs)
   - Billy Idol - Best Of (18 songs)
   - Billy Joel - Very Best Of (18 songs)
   - Creedence Clearwater Revival - Best Of (13 songs)
   - Dire Straits - The Very Best (9 songs)
   - Rolling Stones - Best Of (11 songs)

2. Standardize album naming:
   - Decide on naming convention (with/without artist prefix)
   - Update MongoDB to match file system or vice versa

3. Verify song counts:
   - Check why some albums have different song counts
   - Ensure all songs from file system are imported

4. Consider running sync script:
   - Use sync-albums-from-fs.js to update MongoDB
   - Verify all albums and songs are properly imported
