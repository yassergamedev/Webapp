Webapp Style Guide (derived from styles.css)
===========================================

Color Palette
-------------
Primary: #e94560 (neon pink/red accent)
Secondary: #f5a623 (warm amber)
Accent: #00d4ff (cyan glow)
Dark base: gradients between #1a1a2e, #16213e, #0f3460, #0f0f1e
Light text: #ffffff
Gray text: #6c757d
Utility colors: success #28a745, warning #ffc107, danger #dc3545

Typography
----------
Headings: 'Orbitron', monospace (700 weight)
Body copy: 'Space Mono', monospace
Text styling favors uppercase, tight letter-spacing, neon glows, and text shadows.

Global Layout
-------------
Body uses a 135° gradient background and full‑viewport height.
`#mainScreen` centers the app within 900px, with neon border, rounded corners,
   and column layout (fixed top section + flexible bottom section).
Glassmorphism elements (blur, transparency) appear in search areas and modals.

Tabs & Views
------------
Tabs (.view-tabs / .view-tab) use gradients, border glows, and transitions.
Active tabs feature a primary→pink gradient and drop shadow.
Content views (.content-view) switch between albums, songs, and detail panels.

Cards & Lists
-------------
Album cards (.album-card) and song items (.song-item) share gradient backgrounds,
   neon border hovers, and slide/translate hover animations.
Search results and playlist entries use subtle glowing borders and movement.

Search Interface
----------------
Search container uses glassy gradients, inner/outer glows, focus animations,
   and animated icons (iconPulse keyframes).
Clear buttons are circular gradient pills with hover spin/scale.

Now Playing & Queue
-------------------
Now playing bar combines a vinyl animation (spin keyframes) with neon text.
Queue items and playlist chips rely on flex/scroll snapping and glow states
   (default, playing, pending).

Modals & Forms
--------------
Backdrop blur modals with slide-in animation.
Inputs are bordered by primary color, glow on focus, and use icon adornments.
Buttons (.retro-btn variants) use neon gradients, uppercase text, and hover motion.

Animations
----------
Keyframes defined: searchGlow, iconPulse, spin, slideIn, shake.
Hover states typically adjust translate/scale, drop shadows, and gradient overlays.

Responsive Behavior
-------------------
Multiple @media queries for 768px and 480px breakpoints:
 - Stack sections vertically, adjust padding, shrink grids, and relax sticky elements.
 - Album detail view removes cover image on very small screens.
 - Playlist container switches from grid to scrollable flex chips.

Utility & Screen Classes
------------------------
.hidden toggles visibility; .screen ensures full-height page sections.
Sticky playlist header on desktop, disabled when album detail overlay is active.
Album detail view uses grid layout overrides at file end for better stacking.

Usage

This guide summarizes the stylistic intent. For exact selectors and values, refer
to `styles.css`, which mirrors these descriptions verbatim.
